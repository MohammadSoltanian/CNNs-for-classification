## Features

- Interactive Visualizations: Explore the filters of CNNs with intuitive visualizations.
- Multiple Architectures: Support for various CNN architectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, etc.).
- Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters to tailor the visualizations to your needs.
- Easy Integration: Simple API for integrating with your existing projects.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-filter-visualization.git
cd cnn-filter-visualization
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

After installation, you can visualize the filters of your CNN model with just a few lines of code. Hereâ€™s a quick example:

python
import cnn_visualization as cv

# Load your pre-trained CNN model
model = cv.load_model('path/to/your/model.h5')

# Visualize the filters of a specific layer
cv.visualize_filters(model, layer_name='conv2d_1')


## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can achieve with this project:

- Filter Visualizations: See how different filters respond to various inputs.
- Feature Maps: Understand the feature maps generated by each layer of your CNN.
